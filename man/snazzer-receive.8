.SH "SYNOPSIS"

Receive snapshots from remote host via ssh:

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
First, \fBsnazzer-receive\fR obtains a list of snapshots to be received by running
\&\f(CW\*(C`snazzer \-\-list\-snapshots [args]\*(C'\fR, where [args] are all \fBsnazzer-receive\fR
arguments after the hostname or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR separator argument.
.PP
If the first non-option positional argument is \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`snazzer \-\-list\-snapshots [args]\*(C'\fR is executed locally and [args] will refer to
local filesystem paths. Otherwise, it is taken to mean an ssh hostname which is
used to run the \f(CW\*(C`snazzer \-\-list\-snapshots [args]\*(C'\fR command remotely, and [args]
will refer to paths on that remote host.
.PP
\&\fBsnazzer-receive\fR then iterates through this list of snapshots recreating a
filesystem similar to the source by creating subvolumes and \f(CW\*(C`.snapshotz\*(C'\fR
directories where necessary. Missing snapshots are instantiated directly with
\&\f(CW\*(C`btrfs send\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`btrfs receive\*(C'\fR, using \f(CW\*(C`btrfs send \-p [parent]\*(C'\fR where
possible to reduce transport overhead of incremental snapshots.
.PP
Rather than offer ssh user/port/host specifications through \fBsnazzer-receive\fR,
it is assumed all remote hosts are properly configured through your ssh config
file usually at \f(CW\*(C`$HOME/.ssh/config\*(C'\fR.

\&\fBsnazzer-receive\fR assumes the ssh user (or local user, if receiving a local
filesystem) which will be running \f(CW\*(C`btrfs send\*(C'\fR (among other things) has
passwordless sudo for the commands it needs to run. Only a few commands are
necessary, the following lines in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sudoers\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`/etc/sudoers.d/snazzer\*(C'\fR
should suffice (replace \*(L"sendinguser\*(R" with the actual username you will use):

.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
.IX Header "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
.SS "Remote hosts"
.IX Subsection "Remote hosts"
\&\fBsnazzer-receive\fR relies on running ssh remote commands. It is agnostic about
the auth method used, but this documentation assumes key-based.
.PP
Combined with passwordless sudo, remote hosts are vulnerable to and must have
absolute trust in the ssh key-holder, user and host running \fBsnazzer-receive\fR.
.PP
Your deployment should include or consider the following steps, among others not
listed here, to attempt to reduce the impact of or slow down an attacker which
has gained control of the \fBsnazzer-receive\fR user accounts or ssh keys:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Protect ssh keys
.Sp
The ssh key used to authenticate \fBsnazzer-receive\fR typically has passwordless
sudo for \f(CW\*(C`btrfs send\*(C'\fR (among other things) and you should assume that whomever
wields it has access to everything:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Avoid passphraseless ssh keyfiles
.Sp
This should be obvious: once an attacker has copied such a keyfile they no
longer need the compromised host to authenticate, and you will have a bigger,
more urgent job searching for malicious use (and key removal from machines
which trusted it).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Avoid ssh private keyfiles
.Sp
Even passphrase-protected keyfiles are vulnerable to keyloggers and
memory scraping. Consider using smartcards, TPMs, Yubikeys or GoldKeys etc. to
at least force an attacker to depend on whichever machine has the authentication
device attached.
.Sp
This is especially important when passphrase-protected keyfiles are not
practical (eg. scripted use of \fBsnazzer-receive\fR such as cron).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use the timeout option if using an ssh-agent
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
Grant minimal sudo rights
.Sp
Refer to \*(L"sudo requirements for remote hosts\*(R". Don't give the \fBsnazzer-receive\fR
user the option to run arbitrary commands remotely as root.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR: specify a forced\-command/shell\-wrapper
.Sp
Even if sudo is locked down, don't give the \fBsnazzer-receive\fR user the option
of running arbitrary commands remotely. Use a shell wrapper which permits only
the required sudo commands.
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 provide example
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 Document shell wrapper
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 This does not prevent data exfiltration via \f(CW\*(C`sudo btrfs send\*(C'\fR, but
may slow down an attacker who would abuse the account in other ways.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\*(C'\fR: restrict originating \s-1IP\s0 address
.Sp
Use the \f(CW\*(C`from\*(C'\fR option to limit which machine the \fBsnazzer-receive\fR host's ssh
key may connect from. This might force an attacker to still depend on the
\&\fBsnazzer-receive\fR host even if they have obtained the private key somehow.
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 provide example
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 link to a guide on this
.IP "\(bu" 4
Disable interactive shells/logins
.Sp
Reduce opportunities for the \fBsnazzer-receive\fR user to run arbitrary commands;
remove the account password. \s-1NOTE:\s0 this doesn't stop ssh remote commands.
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 link to a guide on this
.IP "\(bu" 4
Log remote ssh commands
.Sp
Most distros do zero logging of remote ssh commands. Logging such commands may
be your only way to spot abuse of the \fBsnazzer-receive\fR account. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`snazzer\-send\-wrapper\*(C'\fR uses \f(CW\*(C`logger \-p user.info [cmd]\*(C'\fR to log commands on
remote hosts which are invoking \f(CW\*(C`btrfs send\*(C'\fR.
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 link to a guide on this
.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR \fBsnazzer-receive\fR tries to recreate a filesystem similar to that of
the remote host, starting at the current working directory which represents the
root filesystem. If the remote host has a root btrfs filesystem, this means that
the current working directory should itself also be a btrfs subvolume in order
to receive snapshots under ./.snapshotz. However, \fBsnazzer-receive\fR will be
unable to replace the current working directory with a btrfs subvolume if it
isn't already one.
.PP
Therefore, if required, ensure the current working directory is already a btrfs
subvolume prior to running \fBsnazzer-receive\fR if you need to receive btrfs root.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"

.IX Header "TODO"
.IP "1. improve fetch/append of remote host's measurements" 4
.IX Item "1. improve fetch/append of remote host's measurements"
\&\fBsnazzer-receive\fR currently does some clumsy concatenation of the remote host's
measurement file onto the local measurement file for a given snapshot if the
local measurement file is either missing or does not mention that remote host's
hostname. Whilst this supports the simple use-case of wanting to obtain initial
measurements performed on a remote host, once a remote host's measurements have
been appended there is no attempt to append any further measurement results onto
the local measurements file.  If this bothers you, please report detailed
use-cases to the author (patches welcome).
.IP "2. include restricted wrapper script to be used as ssh forced command" 4
.IX Item "2. include restricted wrapper script to be used as ssh forced command"
The snazzer project assumes that systems administrators would prefer to restrict
the possible exposure of a dedicated snazzer remote user account, even if sudo
is locked down. To that end, a wrapper script shall be provided which restricts
possible ssh remote commands to only the few actually necessary for snazzer
operation.
.Sp
Even so, commands which snazzer relies on such as \f(CW\*(C`sudo btrfs send\*(C'\fR are
extremely dangerous no matter if it's the only command allowed by the system \-
securing ssh keys is of utmost importance; consider protecting ssh keys with
smartcards, \s-1TPM,\s0 hardware \s-1OTP\s0 solution such as Yubi/GoldKeys etc.
