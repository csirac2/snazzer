Filename of newline separated list of shell glob patterns of subvolume pathnames
which should be excluded from \f(CW\*(C`snazzer \-\-all\*(C'\fR invocations; compatible with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\-from\*(C'\fR for \fBdu\fR and \fBtar\fR.  Examples of subvolume patterns to
exclude from regular snapshotting: *secret*, var/cache, var/lib/docker/*,
\&.snapshots. The patterns are matched against subvolumes as listed by
\&\f(CW\*(C`btrfs subvolume list <path\*(C'\fR>, without a leading /.
Note that   \fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR \f(CW\*(C`.snapshotz\*(C'\fR is always excluded.

Snapshot naming
.Sp
A choice has been made to mint a single datetime string which is used for all
snapshot names in a given \fBsnazzer\fR snapshot invocation, regardless of how long
or at which exact time the snapshotting process takes place for each subvolume.
This makes for consistency across all subvolumes and filesystems, so that
identifying which snapshots were part of a given snapshotting run is possible.
If the actual datetime of the snapshot event is important to you, this is
available from the \f(CW\*(C`btrfs subvolume show\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1SNAZZER_SUBVOLS_EXCLUDE_FILE\s0 is used with grep \-f
.Sp
A minimal (possibly buggy/incomplete) attempt is made to convert the shell glob
patterns in this file to a regex suitable for grep \-f. The assumption is that
the exclude patterns file should only contain \*(L"boring\*(R" paths. Obvious regex
characters are escaped, however there are likely hostile path glob patterns
which will break things.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&.snapshot_measurements.exclude is a work-around to the btrfs atime bug
.Sp
Snapshots may include empty directories under which some other subvol may have
existed in the original, snapshotted subvolume. However, btrfs has a bug where
these empty directories behave differently to empty directories created with
\&\f(CW\*(C`mkdir\*(C'\fR: atimes always return with the current local time, which is obvioulsy
different from one second to the next. So we have no hope of creating
reproducible shasums or \s-1PGP\s0 signatures unless those directories are excluded
from our measurements of the snapshot. See also:
