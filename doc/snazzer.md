# NAME

snazzer - create read-only `/subvol/.snapshotz/[isodate]` btrfs snapshots,
offers snapshot pruning and measurement

# SYNOPSIS

    snazzer [--prune|--measure [--force ]] [--dry-run] --all

    snazzer [--prune|--measure [--force ]] [--dry-run] --all [mountpoint]

    snazzer [--prune|--measure [--force ]] [--dry-run] subvol1 [subvol2 [...]]

# DESCRIPTION

Examples:

Snapshot all non-excluded subvols on all mounted btrfs filesystems:

    snazzer --all

Prune all non-excluded subvols on all mounted btrfs filesystems:

    snazzer --prune --force --all

Append output of **snazzer-measure** to
`/path/to/subvol/.snapshotz/.measurements/[isodate]` for all snapshots of all
subvolumes on all mounted btrfs filesytems (slow!):

    snazzer --measure --force --all

As above, skipping snapshots already measured by this host (recommended):

    snazzer --measure --all

Print rather than execute commands for snapshotting all non-excluded subvols for
the filesystem mounted at /mnt (including /mnt itself):

    snazzer --dry-run --all /mnt

Prune only the explicitly named subvols at /srv, /var/log and root:

    snazzer --prune /srv /var/log /

# OPTIONS

- **--all** **\[mountpoint\]**: act on all subvolumes under mountpoint. If
mountpoint is omitted, **snazzer** acts on all mounted btrfs filesystems.
- **--prune**: delete rather than create snapshots. Exactly which are no
longer needed is **snazzer-prune-candidates**'s role, documented separately
- **--measure**: append output of **snazzer-measure** to
`/path/to/subvol/.snapshotz/.measurements/[isodate]` By default, only snapshots
which haven't been measured by this hostname are updated - use **--force** to
measure all snapshots
- **--force**: required for **--prune** to carry out any pruning operation.
For **--measure**, this switch overrides the default behaviour of skipping
snapshots already measured by current hostname
- **--list-subvolumes**: list subvolumes that would be acted on
- **--list-snapshots**: list snapshots under subvolumes as above
- **--dry-run**: print rather than execute commands that would be run
- **--help**: Brief help message
- **--man**: Full documentation
- **--man-roff**: Full documentation as \*roff output, Eg:

        snazzer --man-roff | nroff -man

- **--man-markdown**: Full documentation as markdown output, Eg:

        snazzer --man-markdown > snazzer-manpage.md

- **--generate-test-img** `file.img`: create btrfs image for testing

# ENVIRONMENT

- SNAZZER\_SUBVOLS\_EXCLUDE\_FILE

    Filename of newline separated list of shell glob patterns of subvolume pathnames
    which should be excluded from `snazzer --all` invocations; compatible with
    `--exclude-from` for **du** and **tar**.  Examples of subvolume patterns to
    exclude from regular snapshotting: \*secret\*, /var/cache, /var/lib/docker/btrfs,
    .snapshots.  **NOTE:** `.snapshotz` is always excluded.
    Default:

        SNAZZER_SUBVOLS_EXCLUDE_FILE="/etc/snazzer/exclude.patterns"

- SNAZZER\_USE\_UTC=1

    For snapshot naming and **snazzer-measure** output use UTC times of the form
    `YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSSZ` instead of local time+offset `YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS+hhmm`

# BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

- Snapshot naming

    A choice has been made to mint a single datetime string which is used for all
    snapshot names in a given **snazzer** snapshot invocation, regardless of how long
    or at which exact time the snapshotting process takes place for each subvolume.
    This makes for consistency across all subvolumes and filesystems, so that
    identifying which snapshots were part of a given snapshotting run is possible.
    If the actual datetime of the snapshot event is important to you, this is
    available from the `btrfs subvolume show` command.

- BTRFS subvolume path name assumption

    An assumption has been made that a subvolume will mounted under the same path
    (relative to mountpoint) as its path name indicated by `btrfs subvolume list`.
    If you have manually mounted subvolumes under mountpoints inconsistent with this
    assumption, breakage will occur.

- SNAZZER\_SUBVOLS\_EXCLUDE\_FILE is used with grep -v

    A minimal (possibly buggy/incomplete) attempt is made to convert the shell glob
    patterns in this file to a regex suitable for grep -v. The assumption is that
    the exclude patterns file should only contain "boring" paths. Obvious regex
    characters are escaped, however there are likely many possible hostile path glob
    patterns which will break things.

- .snapshot\_measurements.exclude is a work-around to the btrfs atime bug

    Snapshots may include empty directories under which some other subvol may have
    existed in the original, snapshotted subvolume. However, btrfs has a bug where
    these empty directories behave differently to empty directories created with
    `mkdir`: atimes always return with the current local time, which is obvioulsy
    different from one second to the next. So we have no hope of creating
    reproducible shasums or PGP signatures unless those directories are excluded
    from our measurements of the snapshot. See also:

# EXIT STATUS

**snazzer** will abort with an error message printed to STDERR and non-zero exit
status under the following conditions:

- 1. invalid arguments
- 2. path is not a filesystem mountpoint
- 3. one or more paths were not btrfs subvolumes
- 4. prune expected /path/to/subvol/.snapshotz directory which was missing
- 5. prune expected --dry-run or --force
- 6. tried to write a .snapshot\_measurements.exclude file in the snapshot
root, but it already exists in the current subvolume
- 7. tried to perform snapshot measurements while existing measurements are
already in progress, check lock dir at /var/run/snazzer-measure.lock
- 9. tried to display man page with a formatter which is not installed
- 10. missing `snazzer-measure` or `snazzer-prune-candidates` from PATH
- 11. missing `btrfs` command from PATH
