# DESCRIPTION

This is a wrapper script to be used in place of a real login shell (Eg. as an
ssh(1) forced command) in order to restrict the commands available to the user
account used by **snazzer-receive** to run `btrfs send`. It may be utilized by
adding an entry in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the sending host (Eg.
`sendinghost1`) under the user account used by **snazzer-receive** to run
`btrfs send`.  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

    command="/usr/bin/snazzer-send-wrapper",no-port-forwarding, \
        no-X11-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAA...snip...== my key

And then (as an example) receive btrfs snapshots from this `sendinghost1`:

    snazzer-receive sendinghost1 --all

# ENVIRONMENT

- SSH\_ORIGINAL\_COMMAND

    This variable holds the original remote ssh command to be acted upon.

# BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

- This script tries too hard to parse normal shell commands

    A better design would be custom command tokens issued with more easily parsed
    string and argument delimeters. This would require some changes to
    **snazzer-receive**.

    A mitigating factor is that all commands are executed in the form of:

        foo "$@"

    Rather than any variant of the more exciting:

        foo $BAREWORD_ARGUMENTS

    or

        eval "$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND"

    This wrapper script is also sanity-checked with bats regression tests which
    check that only the correct number of arguments, valid arguments, switches,
    path patterns and escape characters are dealt with - anything else is rejected. 

# EXIT STATUS

**snazzer-send-wrapper** will abort with an error message printed to STDERR and
non-zero exit status under the following conditions:

- 2. the command string was not recognized
- 98. the command string was recognized but the arguments were not safe
- 99. the command string was recognized and an attempt was made to
parse/re-pack the arguments however the argument string had dangling quotes or
otherwise confused the parser/"$@" unpacker
